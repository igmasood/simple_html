## Project Structure

The project follows a standard React application structure with component-based organization:

```

## Component Overview

### Core Components

1. **App.jsx**
   - Main application component
   - Handles routing and authentication state
   - Connects all view components

2. **Navbar.jsx**
   - Navigation bar component that appears on all pages
   - Adjusts display based on user authentication status
   - Provides links to key application areas

### View Components

1. **LoginView.jsx**
   - Entry point for instructors
   - Simple form for instructor authentication with employee ID

2. **InstructorDash.jsx**
   - Dashboard displaying all courses created by the instructor
   - Provides course management functionality (create, delete)
   - Entry point to record attendance for specific courses

3. **CourseView.jsx**

### Navigation Flow

The application flow follows a logical progression:

2. After authentication, they are directed to the dashboard
3. From the dashboard, they can:
   - Create new courses
   - Manage existing courses
   - Access attendance recording for any course
4. Attendance links generated can be shared with students

## Technology Stack

- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface
